Subject: Request for Leave Due to Family Medical Emergency and Work-from-Home Arrangement

Dear [Team Lead's Name],

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to inform you that my daughter has recently been diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes, and we are in the process of managing her treatment and care. This situation requires my immediate attention, and I will need some time to support her during this critical period.

In light of this, I would like to request a leave of absence for two weeks, starting from [start date] to [end date], to focus on her care. Following the leave, I kindly request the opportunity to work from home for a month, from [start date of WFH] to [end date of WFH], to maintain flexibility while managing her medical needs.

I am committed to ensuring that all current tasks are handed over smoothly before my leave begins, and during the work-from-home period, I will continue to meet all deadlines and responsibilities.

I appreciate your understanding and support during this time. Please let me know if you require any further information or documentation to process these requests.

Thank you for your consideration.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
