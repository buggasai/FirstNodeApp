Subject: Request for Leave Due to Family Medical Emergency

Dear [Team Lead's Name],

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to inform you that my daughter has recently been diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes, and we are in the process of managing her treatment and care. This sudden change has required immediate medical attention and adjustments to her daily routine, which will need my full attention over the next few weeks.

In light of this, I would like to request a leave of absence for two weeks, starting from [start date] to [end date], to ensure that I can provide the necessary care and support during this critical period. I understand the impact my absence may have on the team's work, and I will do my best to ensure a smooth handover of my current tasks before my leave begins. Please let me know how best to facilitate this transition.

I greatly appreciate your understanding and support during this time. If needed, I am happy to provide any documentation required for this request.

Thank you for your consideration.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
