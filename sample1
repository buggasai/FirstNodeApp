Intent of the Code:
The code aims to remove duplicate integers from a given list of integers, returning a new list containing only the unique elements.

Improvements and Why:

Use HashSet<int> for Efficiency:

Improvement: Replace the nested foreach loop with a HashSet<int>.
Why: HashSet provides constant-time average complexity for checking if an element exists. This significantly improves performance, especially for large lists, compared to the nested loop's complexity.

Code Example:
C#

public List<int> ReduceData(List<int> data)
{
    HashSet<int> seen = new HashSet<int>();
    List<int> reducedData = new List<int>();

    foreach (var item in data)
    {
        if (seen.Add(item)) // Add returns true if the item was not already in the set
        {
            reducedData.Add(item);
        }
    }
    return reducedData;
}
Use LINQ's Distinct() Method:

Improvement: Utilize the Distinct() method from LINQ.
Why: This is the most concise and readable way to achieve the desired result. It leverages built-in functionality for removing duplicates.
Code Example:
C#

public List<int> ReduceData(List<int> data)
{
    return data.Distinct().ToList();
}
Consider Handling Null or Empty Input:

Improvement: Add checks for null or empty input lists.
Why: Prevents potential NullReferenceException and ensures the method handles edge cases gracefully.
Method Naming:

Improvement: Consider renaming the method to something more descriptive, like RemoveDuplicates or GetUniqueElements.
Why: Improves code readability and clarity.
In summary, the original code works but is inefficient. Using HashSet or LINQ's Distinct() method provides significant performance improvements and makes the code more readable and maintainable.
