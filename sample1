Subject: Request for Sabbatical Leave Due to Family Medical Needs

Dear [Supervisorâ€™s Name],

I am writing to request a two-month sabbatical leave, beginning on [start date] and ending on [end date], to support my daughter, who has recently been diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes. She has been experiencing frequent hypoglycemic episodes and requires ongoing medical care and assistance with monitoring her condition, as well as support with school and daily activities.

During this period, I will need to focus on her medical appointments, regular checkups, and help her manage her studies to minimize disruption to her education.

I am fully committed to ensuring a smooth handover of my responsibilities and will work closely with the team to transition tasks effectively before my leave begins. Please let me know if you need any further documentation to process this request or if there are additional formalities to complete.

Thank you very much for your understanding and support during this challenging time. I look forward to your favorable response.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
